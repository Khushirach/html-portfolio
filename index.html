<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am an experienced Product Manager with over five years of expertise in leading cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions that drive business growth and operational efficiency. My work at Value Score Business Solutions LLP and LivLong Life Insurance (IIFL) has focused on market analysis, user experience optimization, and agile project management.

I am proficient in using tools like Zoho Suite, JIRA, SQL, and Azure TFS to turn complex business needs into actionable, strategic plans.
